            <h1>Me in three:</h1>
            <p>I'm an irrevrent technology enthusiast who's currently outnumbered 3:1 by my wife and beautiful daughters in New Hampshire. There's nothing computer related I don't love or am not facinated by, though I'm very partial to Apple and Python.  Am equally at home in jeans/t-shirt or a nicely tailored suit.</p>

            <h1>Importance:</h1>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Criticisms_and_responses_to_criticisms">The Golden Rule</a> works for me. Any system most likley has flaws, but this his simple enough that and it really does cover a lot without being overly philisophical.</p>

        <section class="history">
            <h1>History:</h1>
            <p>Born and raised in New Hampshire, but have listed in the east, west, and middle. Have spent close to 15 years working for Fidelity Investments and currently am a "Senior Systems and Support Analyst" (wow, that's a ridiculously long title).  There I'm  basicaly a jack-of-all-trades for my unit.  I've done desktop support,  project managment, disaster recovery testing, systems work (Windows & Linux), etc, etc.</p>

            <p>My online moniker stemmed from playing Unreal Tournement.  I flipped to to a page in my chemistry book and found Carbon<sup>12</sup>.  Sounded neat to me.  Years later a friend of my basicaly pointed out that "... it's just charcoal".  Which, in simplistic terms, it is.</p>

            <h1>The Small Stuff:</h1>
            <h2>Fun:</h2>
            <p>Video games, food, reading, debate, computers, technology, tinkering, pestering the wife, and continuing my research on how many RPGs I can collect and never play.</p>
            <h2>Dream Job:</h2>
            <p>I can't imagine one.  Not because jobs are bad, but that there are too many options of what would be amazing.</p>
            <h2>Earwig:</h2>
            <p>I've been listening to Five Finger Death Punch a lot, but fill the gaps with podcasts or trying to find new and interesting cover songs. (Try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FS3jCNda4o">this</a> for example).</p>
